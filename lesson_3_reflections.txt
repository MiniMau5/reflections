Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull

1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By pulling  changes manually, you have control of what is being changed- especially sinc eit is open source= in case anyone else has made any chanegs.
