How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it provided the differences - chanegs- so you could see where the error came in

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    that way if you try soemthing that later does not work- you can go back to a previous version- and contineu with your prjoect.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - you can fiddle with a bunch of chanegs then commit what you are ready to commit- without that - you woudl have to go through a bunch of chanegs where you were just playing with the file-\

    cons- sometimes- you may prefer to have it dsaved for you- without having to think about it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

each has its uses

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    they are present and usable!

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  You know you can go back to the previous version!! so experiment!!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
